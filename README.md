# 25-Indian_bird_species_image_classification
Accurate classification model that can identify these bird species based on their images.



The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model to classify different species of 
birds based on input images. The model will be trained using a dataset consisting of 
images of 25 different bird species and will utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
architecture to extract relevant features and make accurate predictions. It aims to 
showcase the potential of deep learning in accurately classifying bird species based on 
their images. It could have significant implications in the field of conservation, where 
accurate identification of species is crucial for their protection and preservation.
I used Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to implement the CNN model. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
